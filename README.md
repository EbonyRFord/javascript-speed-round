"Meep-Meep"

Project Description:

This javascript game will give the user a fun way to test their knowledge of javascript while under pressure due a timer displayed once they start the game.

The game should cycle through a list of questions and will decrease the amount of time alloted if a incorrect response is submitted. 

The game will end when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches zero. High scores can also be saved.
